Got it — let’s break your password manager into **feature-based phases** so you can build it in a logical, incremental way.
I’ll structure it so you get something usable early, then keep layering in advanced functionality.

---

## **Phase 1 — Core MVP (Usable Secure Vault)**

**Goal:** Have a functioning, secure password manager with basic CRUD and sync.

**Features:**

* **User registration & login**

  * Master password creation
  * Argon2id KDF for key derivation
  * Email verification
* **Vault encryption & decryption**

  * AES-256-GCM client-side encryption
  * Store encrypted blobs in DB
* **Basic web dashboard**

  * Add, view, edit, delete vault entries (credentials, secure notes)
  * Organize entries by folder or tags
* **Browser extension (basic)**

  * Popup UI for vault list
  * Autofill on matching domain
* **Backend API**

  * RESTful API with JWT authentication
  * CRUD endpoints for vault items
* **Security**

  * HTTPS/TLS everywhere
  * Rate limiting for login
  * Server stores only encrypted vault data

---

## **Phase 2 — Usability Enhancements**

**Goal:** Improve user experience and speed of daily use.

**Features:**

* **Search in vault** (client-side after decrypting)
* **Password generator** (configurable length, symbols, etc.)
* **Local caching** in browser extension (encrypted IndexedDB)
* **Autolock** vault after inactivity
* **Import/export** vault (encrypted JSON)
* **Settings panel** for user profile, theme, and vault timeout
* **UI polish**

  * Tags & icons for common services
  * Copy-to-clipboard buttons with auto-clear

---

## **Phase 3 — Security Upgrades**

**Goal:** Harden security and support multiple authentication layers.

**Features:**

* **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**

  * TOTP (Google Authenticator, Authy)
  * Optional WebAuthn (YubiKey, fingerprint reader)
* **Breach monitoring**

  * Integration with HaveIBeenPwned API
* **Audit log** (local-only or metadata on server)
* **Encrypted attachments** (small files, e.g., scanned documents)
* **Password strength meter** (zxcvbn library)
* **Master password change** (re-encrypt vault client-side)

---

## **Phase 4 — Advanced Browser Extension Features**

**Goal:** Make the extension a first-class citizen.

**Features:**

* **Credential capture** on login form submission
* **Multi-step form autofill** (username → password on next page)
* **Domain matching rules** (wildcards, subdomains)
* **Context menu integration**
* **Biometric unlock** (if platform supports it)
* **Inline password generator** in form fields

---

## **Phase 5 — Extra Functionality for Power Users**

**Goal:** Add features that differentiate your password manager.

**Features:**

* **Built-in TOTP generator** in vault entries
* **Secure sharing**

  * Encrypted link or recipient’s public key
* **Emergency access** (grant after delay)
* **Custom fields** (e.g., security questions, extra metadata)
* **Secure notes** with rich text formatting
* **Multi-vault support** (separate vaults for personal/work)

---

## **Phase 6 — Scaling & Platform Expansion**

**Goal:** Prepare for more users, more devices.

**Features:**

* **Mobile app (React Native / Flutter)**

  * Biometric unlock
  * Offline mode with sync on reconnect
* **Desktop app** (Electron)
* **API versioning**
* **Cloud sync optimization**

  * Delta sync instead of full vault reload
* **Multi-device login management** (view & revoke sessions)

---

## **Suggested Build Order for You**

If you’re starting solo:

1. **MVP Web + API (Phase 1)**
2. **Basic Browser Extension (Phase 1)**
3. **Usability Enhancements (Phase 2)**
4. **Security Upgrades (Phase 3)**
5. **Extension Autofill/Capture (Phase 4)**
6. **Power User Features (Phase 5)**
7. **Mobile/Desktop & Scalability (Phase 6)**

This way, you’ll have something usable by end of **Phase 1** and can start testing with real users early, while keeping security in place from the start.

If you want, I can now **map each phase to a tech stack & estimated time frame** so you can treat this as a proper project plan with milestones.
That would make it easier to schedule development.
