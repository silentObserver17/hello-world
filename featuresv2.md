### Overview of the Password Manager System

I'll design a secure, user-friendly password manager tailored for individuals. The system will prioritize zero-knowledge architecture, meaning all sensitive data (passwords, files, etc.) is encrypted on the client-side before being stored on the server. This ensures that even if the server is compromised, the data remains unreadable without the user's master password.

The core components will be:
- **Web App Dashboard**: A central hub for managing passwords, sharing, 2FA setup, and file storage.
- **Browser Extension**: For autofill, password generation, and quick access, compatible with major browsers like Chrome, Firefox, and Edge.

Expansion to mobile apps or desktop clients can be considered later, but we'll focus on web and extension for now.

The system will be named "SecureVault" for this design (you can change it).

### Key Features

Based on your requirements, here are the core features, categorized for clarity. I've included standard password manager essentials to make it comprehensive.

#### 1. **Core Password Management**
   - Secure storage of passwords, credit card details, notes, and other credentials in a personal vault.
   - Password generator: Create strong, customizable passwords (e.g., length, character types) with entropy checks.
   - Vault organization: Folders, tags, and search functionality for easy navigation.
   - Import/export: Support importing from CSV or other managers (e.g., LastPass, Bitwarden) and exporting encrypted backups.

#### 2. **Autofill and Browser Integration**
   - Browser extension for autofill on login forms, credit card fields, and address forms.
   - Auto-capture: Detect and save new logins during sign-up or login processes.
   - Quick access: Popup menu in the extension for copying passwords or generating new ones without opening the full dashboard.

#### 3. **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) Support**
   - Built-in 2FA for the password manager account (e.g., TOTP via authenticator apps like Google Authenticator).
   - Storage and management of 2FA secrets: Users can store TOTP seeds for other sites, with auto-generation of codes in the dashboard or extension.
   - Backup codes: Generate and store emergency backup codes for the manager's 2FA.

#### 4. **Password Sharing**
   - Secure sharing: Share individual passwords or entire folders with other users via encrypted links or direct account-to-account sharing (requires recipient to have an account).
   - Permissions: View-only or edit access, with expiration dates and revocation options.
   - Audit logs: Track sharing history, including who accessed what and when.

#### 5. **Secure File Storage**
   - Upload and store files (e.g., documents, images) up to a reasonable limit (e.g., 1GB per user initially).
   - Client-side encryption: Files encrypted before upload.
   - Versioning: Keep file history with options to restore previous versions.
   - Sharing: Similar to passwords, share files securely with expiration and access controls.

#### 6. **Security and Privacy Features**
   - Master password: The only key to decrypt data; use PBKDF2 or Argon2 for hashing.
   - Zero-knowledge encryption: All data encrypted with AES-256 on the client-side.
   - Breach alerts: Integrate with services like Have I Been Pwned to notify users of compromised passwords.
   - Session management: Auto-logout after inactivity, biometric unlock (if expanded to mobile later).
   - Dark web monitoring: Optional feature to scan for leaked credentials (via API integration).

#### 7. **User Experience and Additional Features**
   - Dashboard UI: Clean, intuitive interface with dark/light mode, responsive design for desktop and mobile browsers.
   - Analytics: Personal insights like password strength scores and reuse warnings.
   - Free tier: Basic features for individuals; premium for advanced sharing and larger file storage (monetization option).
   - Accessibility: Support for screen readers, keyboard navigation.

### Technology Stack

I'll suggest a modern, secure, and scalable stack. Focus on open-source where possible for transparency and cost-effectiveness.

#### Frontend (Web App and Browser Extension)
- **Framework**: React.js with TypeScript for type safety and maintainability. Use Create React App for the dashboard and WebExtension APIs for the browser extension.
- **UI Library**: Material-UI or Tailwind CSS for responsive, customizable components.
- **State Management**: Redux or Context API for handling user sessions and vault data.
- **Encryption Library**: Crypto-JS or Web Crypto API for client-side AES-256 encryption.
- **Browser Extension Specifics**: Use Manifest V3 for Chrome/Edge compatibility; polyfills for Firefox.

#### Backend
- **Language/Framework**: Node.js with Express.js for a lightweight API server. Alternatively, Python with FastAPI for better performance in async operations.
- **Authentication**: JWT for session tokens; OAuth2 for potential third-party integrations (e.g., Google login).
- **API Design**: RESTful APIs with GraphQL for flexible queries (e.g., fetching vault items).

#### Database
- **Type**: PostgreSQL for structured data (user accounts, metadata). Use row-level security and encryption at rest.
- **NoSQL for Files**: Integrate with Amazon S3 or MinIO (self-hosted) for blob storage of encrypted files and backups.
- **Caching**: Redis for session management and rate limiting.

#### Security and Infrastructure
- **Encryption/Hashing**: Argon2 for password hashing; AES-256-GCM for data encryption.
- **Monitoring**: Sentry for error tracking; OWASP guidelines for security best practices.
- **Deployment**: Docker for containerization; Kubernetes if scaling later. Host on AWS, Vercel (for frontend), or Heroku for simplicity.
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment.
- **Other Tools**: 
  - Have I Been Pwned API for breach checks.
  - Twilio or Authy for optional SMS 2FA backups.

This stack is cost-effective for startups (free tiers available) and emphasizes security with minimal dependencies.

### System Design

#### High-Level Architecture
- **Client-Side (Zero-Knowledge)**: The web app/extension handles encryption/decryption using the master password-derived key. Data is never sent unencrypted to the server.
- **Server-Side**: Acts as a "dumb" storage for encrypted blobs. Handles authentication, metadata (e.g., item names, without content), and sharing logic.
- **Data Flow**:
  1. User logs in via web/extension: Authenticates with email/master password hash.
  2. Vault sync: Encrypted data pulled from server, decrypted locally.
  3. Autofill: Extension injects scripts into pages to detect forms and fill from decrypted vault.
  4. Sharing: Generate encrypted shares with recipient's public key (using asymmetric encryption like RSA).
  5. File Storage: Upload encrypted files to blob storage; metadata stored in DB.
- **Scalability**: Use microservices for auth, storage, and notifications. Serverless options (e.g., AWS Lambda) for low-traffic starts.
- **Potential Challenges**:
  - Key management: Ensure master password recovery via security questions or backups (but warn of risks).
  - Cross-browser compatibility: Test extension on multiple platforms.
  - Compliance: Aim for GDPR/SOC2 standards for user trust.

#### UI/UX Design Principles
- **Minimalist Interface**: Dashboard with sidebar navigation (Vault, Sharing, Files, Settings).
- **Onboarding**: Guided setup for master password and 2FA.
- **Extension Popup**: Compact view with search bar, generator, and recent items.
- **Wireframes**: (Conceptual) Use tools like Figma for prototyping â€“ dashboard home shows vault overview; extension shows form-fill prompts.

### Development Phases

I'll outline phased development to build iteratively, starting with MVP (Minimum Viable Product) and expanding. Assume a small team (1-3 developers); timeline is approximate for full-time effort.

#### Phase 1: Planning and Research (2-4 weeks)
